# Gesture_Recognition-project
Gesture recognition is a computer vision project that detects and interprets human hand movements through a webcam. It uses MediaPipe to track hand landmarks and OpenCV to process video frames. By analyzing finger positions, the system identifies gestures such as open palm, fist, or thumbs up and displays the result instantly on the screen.
